              Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or
              other animals as food. The original meaning is still commonly used
              and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant
              matter, including the flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, roots, and
              seeds. An alternative definition of the term is applied somewhat
              arbitrarily, often by culinary and cultural tradition. It may
              exclude foods derived from some plants that are fruits, flowers,
              nuts, and cereal grains, but include savoury fruits such as
              tomatoes and courgettes, flowers such as broccoli, and seeds such
              as pulses.

            <p  id="d"> Vegetables have been part of the human diet from time immemorial.
              Some are staple foods but most are accessory foodstuffs, adding
              variety to meals with their unique flavors and at the same time,
              adding nutrients necessary for health. Some vegetables are
              perennials but most are annuals and biennials, usually harvested
              within a year of sowing or planting. Whatever system is used for
              growing crops, cultivation follows a similar pattern; preparation
              of the soil by loosening it, removing or burying weeds, and adding
              organic manures or fertilisers; sowing seeds or planting young
              plants; tending the crop while it grows to reduce weed
              competition, control pests, and provide sufficient water;
              harvesting the crop when it is ready; sorting, storing, and
              marketing the crop or eating it fresh from the ground.[34]</p></div>
